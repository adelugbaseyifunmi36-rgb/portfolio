I'm Adelugba Oluwaseyifunmi, a passionate frontend developer and creative coder from Lagos, Nigeria. Currently a Computer Science student at Babcock University. I love turning ideas into interactive, visually engaging web experiences using modern web technologies.
When I'm not coding, I'm exploring design trends, listening to Afrobeats, or sketching new concepts.
Open to freelance projects, collaborations, internships, or just interesting conversations!
